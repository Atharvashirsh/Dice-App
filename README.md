# Dice-App
This repo contains a Mini Dice Game I made in Flutter.

## How it works?
🕹 The player taps on Dice 1 🎲 and it changes the number on top of it.<br>
🕹 Dice 2 🎲 is played by the Computer and it changes when on Player's input.<br>
🕹 The Winner 🏆 is decided by whose dice's number is bigger.

## In-Progress
⌚ Currently working on the Winning animation and Score-Board.
